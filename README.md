# **Radon Data Analysis in Florida Counties**

This project analyzes radon testing data across counties in Florida using RStudio. As a beginner in RStudio, I developed this project to practice data analysis and visualization skills while exploring an important environmental health topic. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, making this analysis vital for identifying areas with significant testing activity.

## **Project Overview**
- **Role:** Environmental Health Analyst (Beginner in RStudio)
- **Objective:** Visualize the distribution of radon testing across counties and highlight key regions with significant testing efforts.
- **Dataset:** Radon testing data for Florida counties

## **Included Visualizations**
1. **Bar Chart:** Top 5 counties with the highest number of buildings tested for radon.
2. **Histogram:** Distribution of radon testing values across all counties.
3. **Pie Chart:** Proportion of total buildings tested in the top 5 counties.
4. **Boxplot:** Spread and variability of radon testing across counties.

## **Key Findings**
- The top 5 counties with the highest number of buildings tested are highlighted, showing where testing efforts are concentrated.
- The visualizations help guide decision-making for public health interventions in regions with potential radon exposure risks.
